    <p><h3>Var:</h3>With var we declare a identity.If declared without intitialisation they hold value as undefined.Scope, the region of accecibility for a paricular identifier. There are two type of scope<b> global scope</b> and <b>function scope</b>.</p>
    <p><b>Global scope:</b><br>If a identifier is declared with a global scope it can be accessed from any part of the program.</p>
    <p><b>Function scope:</b><br>If a identifier is declared with in a function by using var then it won't be accessable out of the function.</p>
    <p><h3>Let:</h3>Similar to var let is also used to declare an identifier,but let is sccoped differently than var.Let is blocked scoped or it's bounded in the block of in{} as compared to function scoped var and we get RefrenceError when acessing a variable declared by let. </p>
    <p><h3>Const:</h3>Const is almost exactly the same as let. However, we cannot change the value of const variable once defined</p>
